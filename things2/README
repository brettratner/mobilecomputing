Things - Using SQLite (no model)

Developed using Titanium Studio
Author: John Kuiphoff

This example uses the traditional implementation of SQLite. I find that this 
approach is easier than the preferred 'models' implementation. 

In addition, I've included the models as well implementation as well 
so that developers can have access to  both approaches: https://github.com/jkuip/mobilecomputing/tree/master/things
