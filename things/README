Things - Using a model

Developed using Titanium Studio
Author: John Kuiphoff

This example uses a model (with an sql adapter). I find that this approach is more 
difficult than using the native SQLite implementation / syntax. In addition, I've 
included the tranditional SQLite implementation as well so that developers can have access to 
both approaches.
